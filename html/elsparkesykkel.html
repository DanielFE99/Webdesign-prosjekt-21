		<h2 class="gridheading">The El-Scooters of Bergen</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			There are currently five different electric scooter operators in Bergen:
		</h5>
		<ul class="introtext">
				<li>Bird</li>
				<li>Bolt</li>
				<li>Voi</li>
				<li>Tier</li>
				<li>Ryde</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="maintext">
			All the electric scooters work the same, but each of the operators have their independent apps, so make sure to download the app for the one you want to use. The electric scooters are unlocked with the app. Pricing varies from a single trip where the amount is based on time spent, other alternatives are daily or monthly passes. Prices have a slight variation. The electric scooters can be driven on the sidewalk if careful, but are best driven in dedicated bike lanes. Bike lanes are common in most parts of the city centre. Electric scooters are found in most populated areas of Bergen and especially the city centre.

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by E-scooter?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		By habit I usually grab the E-scooters when I’m in the city centre. The bus lines going from Danmarksplass to Nordnes for example doesn’t have the most frequent travel schedule, so for short trips like that it’s often more effective hopping on an E-scooter.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by E-scooter compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I much prefer the fresh air of traveling by E-scooter than a bus full of people. Especially on summer days the buses can be really warm, on days like that I prefer the E-scooters.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by E-scooter, what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Make sure to download the correct app for the E-scooter you’re trying to use as all of the operators have different apps.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by E-scooter?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		If you travel in the rush hour it can be pretty cramped, so just be aware that you might have to stand. But if you’re on the elderly side people will usually ask if you would like to have their seat so I wouldn’t worry about that.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Where can I go by El-scooter?</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			We recommend El-scooters for shorter trips in densely populated areas like the city center or Åsane.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			El-scooter is a very useful transportation method to get from places like Bryggen and over to Akvariet. Although these two attractions are located in the city center there is still a good amount of distance between them for a walk. The bus connection between these two places of interest isn’t the best either as line 11 that drives close to Akvariet only departs every hour. 
			El-scooter is therefore a popular means of transportation between these two areas and is one we would recommend for going to attractions 	like Akvariet or Bryggen.
