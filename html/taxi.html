		<h5 class="introtext">
			The city of Bergen has three different taxi companies in current operation:
		</h5>
		<ul class="introtext">
				<li><strong>Bergen Taxi 0700</strong></li>
				<li><strong>NorgesTaxi</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Taxi1</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="maintext">
			The pricing depends on a lot of variables, so make sure to check the given websites for specific pricing estimate. Ordering a trip can be done online, in apps for the given companies, by phone or in person. Paying by card is the easiest as cash is becoming a less common method of payment and not all drivers have the right amount of change available.

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by taxi?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I choose to travel by taxi when I need more flexibility. Sometimes it’s easier calling a taxi that picks you up at home and drives you directly to where you need to go. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by taxi compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		It’s very flexible as you can be picked up pretty much everywhere and go wherever you need quickly. If you’re being picked up at home you can wait inside which is preferable especially on cold days. I prefer it over freezing at the bus stop. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about Bybanen what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
			Make sure that when you order a taxi by call or app that you double check the address. If you enter the wrong one it can be annoying and tedious when the driver doesn’t find you. But it usually is fine.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by taxi?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Be prepared that it is a lot more expensive than other means of transportation, so make sure you have estimated enough to pay for the trip.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Where should I go by taxi?</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			Taxi can be a useful means of transportation in Bergen, but can be hard to know when to use and when you can catch a bus.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			Taxi is probably the most flexible transportation method in Bergen when it comes to traveling around to see attractions. Taxis will drive you pretty much anywhere you want which means you can go exactly where you want without having to walk from a bus stop. We have no specific recommendation on what places are the best to go to by taxi, but we recommend considering it according to your own schedule as it can save you some time.
