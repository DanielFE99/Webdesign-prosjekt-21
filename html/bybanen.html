		<h5 class="introtext">
			Bybanen is Bergen’s only light rail, the route goes from Bergen city centre to Bergen airport with 25 other stops along the way.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			The location of these stops and live tracker of Bybanen can be found at Bybanes website. Bybanen is operated by Skyss, the same company that operates all local buses. Skyss tickets are therefore usable for both means of transportation. However, unlike buses, tickets can not be bought on the light rail itself. Tickets need to be bought at one of the Bybane stops, or from the Skyss app. Prices for adults are 60 NOK for a single ticket and 230 NOK for a week pass. If you have a valid ISIC student card you can buy a week pass for 140 NOK.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Advice for Bybanen travel</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			Here are some of our general tips for traveling with Bybanen.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			Bybanen is a very popular means of transportation in Bergen, and can therefore be very crowded during morning rush at roughly 7-10am and after work rush hours at roughly 5-6pm. Other times it can be overly crowded and almost important to get seating is during Brann matches (local football team) and national holidays or events such as the National day of Norway 17th of May. During a holiday scenario getting on Bybanen at an early stop close to either of the end stations is a useful tip. If there is a Brann match we suggest that you avoid Bybanen roughly up to 45 minutes after the end of the match.
			Except for this Bybanen is a very useful means of transportation in Bergen and we higly suggest you use it. Bybanen is a popular
			mean of transportation to Bergen Airport, but if your goal is to reach a flight we suggest you plan for delays, as they can occur.

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to use Bybanen?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I travel by Bybanen for various occasions. Bybanen has a lot of stops useful to me such as Lagunen shopping mall, Brann stadion and Bergen airport. Bybanen is what I prefer to travel by when I go to football games or have to catch a plane.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling with Bybanen compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		In situations like going to catch a plane or football game you can almost always trust Bybanen. In my own experience there is much less risk of delays compared to getting stuck in traffic with a bus or taxi. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about Bybanen what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Hmmm… though one, but I think I would say that Bybanen is by far the best method of transportation going to or from Bergen Airport as you have more space for luggage than on a cramped bus for example. It’s also more affordable than catching a taxi which can be a plus.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to Bybanen?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		If you travel in the rush hour it can be pretty cramped, so just be aware that you might have to stand. But if you’re on the elderly side people will usually ask if you would like to have their seat so I wouldn’t worry about that.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any complaints yourself about Bybanen?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		The seats are a bit less comfortable than the buses here, but otherwise I am very happy with what Bybanen has to offer in terms of traveling.
