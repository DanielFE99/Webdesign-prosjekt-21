		<h5 class="introtext">
			Bergen has a good offer of different buslines covering large areas in and around Bergen.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			There are 6 main bus lines – they all take you from one part of Bergen to another, and they all go through the city center on the way there. The remaining 40 or so routes act as “filling routes” – the main ones take you a way toward where you want to go, but if you want to go past the main districts, you will need to take one of the connecting local lines. The routes normally do not correspond, so if you need to take two or more buses and want to avoid long periods of waiting between your departures, you should take care to plan your journey in advance.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Schedules and info</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			Although Bergen offers a wide variety of different buslines their schedule greatly varies depending on their route. 
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			Despite many buslines having frequent departures, traveling at rush times is going to be slow, especially if you’re going through one of the “bottlenecks” of Bergen, or through the city center. Rush times are between 6:30 and 8:30 in the morning, and 3 and 5 in the evening – anticipate 10-30 minutes additional travel time if you plan to take a bus in this time frame.
			<br>
			The buses in Bergen are owned by the company Skyss – they have a visitor’s center by the main bus station in Bergen, <a href="https://www.skyss.no">the Skyss official website</a>, the app Skyss Billett for purchasing tickets and the app Skyss Reise for planning your travels. You can also plan your journey from their website. All of Skyss’ buses run on either electricity or green fuels, so you can travel with a clear conscience!

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by bus?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I travel by bus in Bergen very often, usually to and from work. I have many bus stops available in my area and therefore many different bus lines to pick from. The good thing is that they all have many stops in the city centre such as Danmarks Plass or Bryggen.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by bus compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
		The best thing for me is that there is a bus line that covers almost every area in Bergen. The bus schedule is very good and it’s therefore very easy to go off at a bus stop and change lines. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by bus what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Make sure you download the app in good time and buy the ticket. The app can be slow so it’s not something you want to do on the bus. From my experience there are often ticket controls, and it’s not fun ending up with a big ticket.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by Bergen Bysykkel, what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Make sure you are prepared for all the hills in Bergen. It’s fun downhill, but can be exhausting uphill. If you need to be somewhere on time make sure you estimate enough time for it when traveling by Bergen Bysykkel.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by bus?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Be prepared that some popular bus lines can be full during the rush hours. But usually as you get further away from the city centre the bus becomes less empty as more people go off the bus than on.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Pricing and payment</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			The local bus company Skyss offers different type of tickets and pricing, but some have more pros than others.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			Skyss has divided tickets into geographical zones ranging from A to F. When buying a ticket make sure this
			corresponds to the zone you want to travel within. This can be done using the Skyss website or app linked above.
			The cheapest way to buy a ticket is by using the Skyss app or a ticket machine. Ticket machines are located at
			most bus terminals, but are <strong>not</strong> located at every bus stop. Tickets can also be bought by entering 
			the bus and paying the bus driver, however this has an additional cost of 21 NOK for adults, 10 NOK for kids and elderly.
			<br>
			Buying single tickets are expensive in comparison to week or month passes, single tickets for adults and students are 60 NOK
			for students and adults. Week pass is 230 NOK for adults and 140 NOK for students. Students from institutions abroad need a valid ISIC card to be eligble for student pass. Here you can find 
			<a href="https://www.skyss.no/en/tickets-and-prices/tickets-and-prices2/">detailed information about ticket prices</a>.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Where can I go by bus?</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			As Bergen has a fairly good bus offer the different lines can lead you to many attractions and places worth seeing.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			The best way to get to mount Ulriken from the city center is by  bus as there are multiple bus stops starting close to the mountain, you can find a very detailed overview of this here.
			As transportation options like Bybanen do not go in the direction of Åsane, if you are looking to go anywhere in Åsane like the Åsane shopping mall bus is very useful as there are many bus stops and a bus station located right by the mall. Except for that any attraction on the outskirts of Bergen is most likely going to have bus lines stopping somewhat close to it.
