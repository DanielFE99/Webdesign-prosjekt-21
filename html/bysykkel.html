  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by Bergen Bysykkel?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I use Bergen Bysykkel when it makes sense in terms of where I am going. You have to park the bicycles at a dedicated Bergen Bysykkel station, so when I am heading to a place where one is close it is a preferable means of transportation for me.
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by Bergen Bysykkel compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		You can get a year pass for 399 NOK which is almost the same amount I would have to pay for a monthly pass on bus and Bybanen. Cycling also is a refreshing feeling and starts the day. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by E-scooter, what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Make sure you are prepared for all the hills in Bergen. It’s fun downhill, but can be exhausting uphill. If you need to be somewhere on time make sure you estimate enough time for it when traveling by Bergen Bysykkel.

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by Bergen Bysykkel?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Do so when the weather is fitting. I don’t find it as fun to cycle when it’s pouring down as it often does in Bergen. Avoid at all costs if it’s snowy as it’s not really made for those conditions.

			Bergen Bysykkel - a good option for seeing attractions near the city center
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			We recommend Bergen Bysykkel for use if you are going somewhere close to a Bergen Bysykkel station, as you can find on the Bergen Bysykkel interactive map. The good thing is that these stations are vastly located around attractions and points of interest such as Bryggen, University Museum of Bergen and much more. We therefore see Bergen Bysykkel as a good option for going to attractions in or around the city center.
