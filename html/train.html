		<h5 class="introtext">
			Arnalokalen is the most local train in the Bergen area. The trainline goes directly from Bergen central train station to Arna station.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			The train is operated by Vy, which runs most train lines in Norway. From monday to friday the train leaves Bergen central station roughly every thirty minutes. Saturdays and Sundays the train has a more random schedule so make sure to check the website Vy.no. For tickets you can buy online at Vy.no or use a ticket machine located at the train station. Ticket Price is 40NOK each way, or free with a Skyss card. Skyss cards can be bought in the Skyss app which is found in the App store.
			Information about pricing, discounts etc. for a Skyss pass can be found at 
			<a href="https://www.skyss.no/en/tickets-and-prices/tickets-and-prices2/">the Skyss website</a>. Buying a single ticket can be done
			through the <a href="https://www.vy.no/en">Vy website</a>.

		<h5 class="introtext">
			The trainline “Vossebanen” travels from Bergen to Voss and takes approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. As the time estimate suggests the train is less local than the other local train “Arnalokalen” but is still considered a local train.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			The train is operated by Vy and is scheduled at different times, so make sure to check Vy. Tickets can be bought at Vy or at a ticket machine at Bergen central train station. If you have a Skyss card for zone A, E and F this also counts as a valid ticket. However keep in mind this only counts for Vossebanen, Bergensbanen which travels from Bergen to Oslo with a stop at Voss does not accept Skyss card as a valid ticket. Information about pricing, discounts etc. for a Skyss pass can be found at 
			<a href="https://www.skyss.no/en/tickets-and-prices/tickets-and-prices2/">the Skyss website</a>. Buying a single ticket can be done

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by local train?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I travel by local train when going to Arna, Voss or pretty much any stop along the way as it is in my opinion the most practical option for going to these areas. It’s also environmentally friendly which is a big plus for me. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by local train compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		The best thing about traveling to for example Voss or Arna by train over bus in my opinion, is that it’s more comfortable and an efficient way of travelling. The seats are nice and clean, the train is warm so you can travel in comfort. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by local train what would it be?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		The train to Voss travels through a lot of tunnels, this means that reception and mobile data can be pretty bad so just be prepared to spend some time without it. If you buy your ticket on the phone I would suggest screenshotting the QR code, if mobile reception is bad it might take a long time to load. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by local train?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		Make sure you get on the right train, Bergen train station is usually very informative with digital displays showing where the train is heading so make sure to read them. And if I can add one more thing: on the train you are advised to store your luggage overhead, make sure you remember to bring it with you when you go off. I know from experience…

		<h2 class="gridheading">What to see when taking the train</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			Even though the longer train ride from Bergen to Voss is interesting in itself there is more to come when you arrive!
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			If you plan on  taking the train for things to do we recommend taking the train to Voss. At Voss you can find Voss Vind where you can experience how it feels to skydive in a wind tunnel. You can travel up Mount Hanguren  with the modern Voss Gondol. In winter this is a great place for skiing during winter, and for walks during warmer seasons. If you have the opportunity we greatly suggest you take this train journey.
