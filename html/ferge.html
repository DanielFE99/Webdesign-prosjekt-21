		<h2 class="gridheading">Travel by boat - "Hurtigbåten"</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			From Strandkaiterminalen in Bergen Center, you can take the “Hurtigbåt” – literally translated to Fast Boat, they travel at up to 40 kilometers an hour, and the seating is comfortable.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			You can take the Hurtigbåt to Kleppestø from Bergen Center. This boat is incredibly convenient – for one, there are no traffic jams when traveling by sea. The hurtigbåt also has a great capacity of passengers – up to 200 people can fit on one boat. Further, the crossing only takes 13 minutes. If you are traveling from Askøy, there are parking facilities right by the boat terminal. As any other traffic to the city center, it fills up during the rush hour. It has departures every half hour between 6 in the morning and 6:30 in the evening. Like the Bybanen and the buses of Bergen, the hurtigbåt is run by the company Skyss – any ticket you buy can be used for any of these transports for as long as the ticket is valid.

  	<p class="question">When do you choose to travel by ferry?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		I don’t often go by ferry but when I do so it’s the Våge - Halhjem ferry. I do so when heading from Halhjem right outside Bergen to Våge or the other way around. It’s faster than driving around and more relaxing. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">What is the best thing about traveling by Bergen Bysykkel compared to other available transportation options?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		There aren't many other transportation options in this regard, there is a road that you could drive instead of going by ferry but it takes longer and there isn’t really any public transportation option. The ferry is comfortable and the best way of traveling in this area in my opinion. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">If there is one thing you think travelers visiting Bergen should know about traveling by ferry, what would it be?
  	</p>
  	<p class="answer">
			I think more travelers should know about it, because going by Ferry to Våge for example is a nice way to see a more rural area of western Norway right outside Bergen. It’s free if you travel without a car or motorcycle which can be a plus for backpackers. There are also USB charging ports on the ferry so it’s a good place to sit and relax while letting your phone charge. 
  	</p>

  	<p class="question">Do you have any warnings to travelers when it comes to traveling by ferry?</p>
  	<p class="answer">
  		As the Halhjem - Våge/Våge - Halhjem has a pretty rare schedule I would recommend estimating good time for going to the port, if you miss the ferry you might have to wait close to 2 hours.

		<h2 class="gridheading">Where can I go by ferry?</h2>
		<h5 class="introtext">
			Here are some advice on where you should go.
		</h5>
		<p class="maintext">
			One of the ferries you can take right outside Bergen is the Halhjem - Våge ferry. It will take you to Våge which is the port of Tysnes. In summertime there are arranged a music festival along with plenty of other activities called Tysnesfest. It is a small island so not many arrangements happen every year, but Tysnes also has plenty of places for fishing and to enjoy the shore. We recommend you take this journey especially in summertime if you can make it in time for the music festival.
