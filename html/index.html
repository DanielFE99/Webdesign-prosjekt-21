            <h1 id="bybanen_headline">Bybanen</h1>
            <p  id="bybanen_intro">Bergen’s «Bybanen», a crossover between a train and a tram,  is maybe the most popular public transport in Bergen. Every few minutes, it transports a hundred or so passengers between Bergen City Center and Bergen airport, with 25 stops in between. If your destination lies somewhere along the route of the Bybanen, we can confidently say that the Bybanen is almost always the most robust choice of transportation!</p>

        <section id="el-scooters">
            <h1 id="elscooter_headline">El-Scooters</h1>
            <p id="elscooter_intro">Since electrical scooters were introduced to Bergen, they have spread to most villages and streets of the city. With a speed limit of 20 km/h, they make for a convenient (albeit disputed) way to travel short distances, especially if you have little to carry. They may be particularly handy when you are in a hurry; you can usually find one close by, and you can take all the shortcuts the buses go around!</p>

        <section id="city-bike">
            <h1 id="citybike_headline">City Bikes</h1>
            <p id="citybike_intro">If you find yourself in the city center, Sandviken or Kronstad, you can rent an electrical City Bike. You will be free to use it for the duration of your ticket, anywhere – just park it in a designated parking zone when you are done! However, make sure to bring a towel if you care for staying dry – these bikes are not sheltered from the weather, and the most common weather in Bergen is, after all, rain!

        <section id="bus">
            <h1 id="bus_headline">Busses</h1>
            <p id="bus_intro">With 6 main lines and at least 40 additional complimentary lines, and most of them having frequent departures from early morning to after midnight, you’ll be sure to find one to take you almost anywhere you might want to go, when you want to go there! Only just beware of cutting it close in rush times – in fact, add 10-30 minutes to the travel time to be safe! </p>

        <section id="train">
            <h1 id="train_headline">Train</h1>
            <p id="train_intro">The trains from Bergen leave from the city center, right by the main bus station. From here, you can take a long-range train to Oslo and Stavanger, or the local train Arna. The train to Arna makes a speedy alternative to bussing there, while the trains to Oslo and Stavanger allows for a longer, but stress-free journey to your city of choice!  </p>

        <section id="boat">
            <h1 id="boat_headline">Boat</h1>
            <p id="boat_intro">From Strandkaiterminalen in Bergen Center, you can take the “Hurtigbåt” – literally translated to the Fast Boat, they travel at up to 37 kilometers an hour, and the seating is comfortable. You can take the Hurtigbåt to Kleppestø from Bergen Center every half hour, effectively escaping any road rage in the bottleneck of Laksevåg!  </p>

        <section id="taxi">
            <h1 id="taxi_headline">Taxi</h1>
            <p id="taxi_intro">Incredibly convenient late at night or when you need to transport something, the Taxis of Bergen are always at your disposal! There are three companies, and you can usually find at least one taxi in every District not too far from the City Center. However, by far the most reliable way of hailing one is calling the respective companies, or ordering a taxi through the companies’ apps. </p>
